# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
For this project we were tasked with working for an imaginary client named DriverPass. They were a company that was looking to fill in some gaps
to provide learning materials, tests, and lessons for people trying to pass their driving exam. They wanted a web page as well as app in order
to fill this gap that would use information from the DMV. We were given an initial interview to work with and used that information throughout the project.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I understood what the client wanted and was able to put together a presentation that would excite them. This presentation can be found in the documents
under 'CS 255 Client Presention Wiltshire'. We were provided the template for this presentation, but I added some slides to include more information that I 
thought was needed. We were instructed to present this as if we were presenting to a non-technical audience. Since I have worked for a decade in an industry
that requires me to often be in front of groups, I think I was able to merge my recent learning with my past experiences well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would fix my use case UML diagram. I did not link actions that should be linked and I did not include a box around the actions to indicate
the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Early in my career I was told to ask 'why' multiple times in order to get to the real reason that someone is requesting something. The interview that
was provided did this in some cases, but we were also left to interpret the information on our owm sometimes. The user is the most important part of designing
any system. They are the ones that will ultimately determine the success or failure for the system. The easier it is for them to use and the more vaulue it provides,
the more likely they will be to interact with it. I think this is the genious behind the one click purchase for Amazon. It removes so many issues and it literally can't
get easier to purchase something quickly.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think that you have to start with the requirement analysis to find out what the client wants and what the user will see. From there you can plan and 
create the arcitecture of the system on a high level. From there you need to create the proper UML diagrams and plan how everything with connect. Then you must
select the technology to use and think about the security that you will be implementing. Next would be the implementation and testing portion. Finally you would have the deployment
and support of the final product. I mentioned it before, but I truly believe that the user experience is the main goal of every application. If we can 
perfect the user experience then we will create a desire to use the system more and thus increase the chances for a sale, subscription, or positive review. 
Creating a psoitive interaction with our system will eventually lead to the financial success of the system.
